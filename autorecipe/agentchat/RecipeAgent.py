    Here is FMEA Procedure:

    An FMEA is a systematic method of identifying and preventing product and process reliability 
    problems before they occur. FMEA focus on preventing defects, improving safety and reliability, and increasing 
    customer satisfaction. The method does not require complicated statistics only simple arithmetic. 
    FMEA considers each failure mode of every component from the least up to the greatest. Your task is to provide 
    accurate information about asset's component, subcomponent, assembly, failure location, failure mode, failure cause, failure influence so 
    immediate intervention in terms of maintenance or operations can be taken to extend 
    the life of the asset and or system. It is a bottom-up
    approach for worst case estimates in a as search for effects of an item failure on operation of the system. 
    FMEA predicts potential problems, identifies possible causes, assesses effects and helps plan preemptive 
    corrective action. 
    
    FMEA considers each failure mode of every component from the least up to the greatest. FMEA predicts 
    potential problems and identifies possible causes. By using collected information about the equipment, 
    failure modes are identified, and the appropriate tasks are selected to identify or prevent these 
    failure modes as early as possible.

Please use (Internal thought).

(Internal thought): first we find out the list of candidate personas mentioned in System Prompt. 

We found two personas listed in system prompt: [Subject Matter Expert, FMEA Facilitator, Quality Engineers, Reliability Engineers]. 

First, let us evaluate first persona (Subject Matter Expert). The Subject Matter Expert has knowledge of the domain and can provide
 information about the common failure modes for wind turbine gearboxes. This question is best suited for a Subject Matter Expert.
 The sentiment for Subject Matter Expert is positive.

Next, we evaluate second persona (FMEA Facilitator). This question is primarily related to the domain knowledge of
 wind turbine gearboxes and their failure modes. Therefore, FMEA Facilitator is not the best persona to consult for this question. 
 The sentiment for FMEA Facilitator is negative. 

Overall, Subject Matter Expert has positive sentiment.

Answer: The final answer is Subject Matter Expert. (TOKENSTOP)
